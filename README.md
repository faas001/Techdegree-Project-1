Project creates an array of quote objects and then randomly selects a quote to display on the screen.

Background color changes to random color each time the quote changes on screen.

A new random quote is displayed every 20s or when button is clicked to show another quote.

This was the first project in the Treehouse JavaScript Techdegree certificate program.
